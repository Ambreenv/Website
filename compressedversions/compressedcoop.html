<a name=coop1> <h3> Engineering Outreach </h3> </a>
<h5>May-August 2017 </h5>
<p>For my first co-op, I was working at the University of Waterloo as an Engineering Outreach Leader. I created projects on PCB design, circuits, bread boarding, programming and Arduino. I taught students, around the ages of 12-13, about topics such as programming and logic, 3D design software, and applications of technology by implementing fun lessons and projects that I had come up with. I had a lot of fun doing this job because it allowed me to learn a variety of skills such as soldering, arduinos, and programming. At the end of the term we had a banquet which was a good way to say goodbye to everyone before returning to school in September. I had a lot of fun on this co-op and the people I worked with made the job even better! </br> <br></p>

<h5>January-April 2018 </h5>
<p>For my second co-op I moved to downtown Toronto to work at a small startup company called DubDub. I was a Software Engineer in Test which was a good way to get familiar with the software field. I mainly created and maintained the test automation suites and analyzed test results that were communicated to the Engineering lead. I was able to learn a lot about different frameworks that are used for testing and how to test applications to ensure that they're running as smoothly and efficiently as possible. Getting to live in Toronto for 4 months and work for a start up company was a really fun experience and it allowed me to see how a company operates in its beginning stages. </p>
